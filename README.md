Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It ensures that software is efficient, dependable, scalable, and manageable. Its significance derives from the fact that we are able to create modern day applications that makes work easier and faster.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s - Structured Programming: Introduction of structured programming techniques improved code readability and reusability.
1968 - Software Engineering Conference: The term "software engineering" was coined, acknowledging the need for disciplined development practices.
1990s - Agile Manifesto: Agile development methodologies introduced flexibility and iterative processes, focusing on customer feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement: is the process of gathering and defining users needs.
Design: involves planning the program architecture and system components.
Implementation: Writing and developing software code.
Testing: Ensuring that the software works as intended and resolving any bugs.
Deployment: is the process of releasing software for use by end users.
Maintenance: Post-deployment updates and bug fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodlogy is a sequential approch with distinct phaswes whilst agile methology uses an iterative and incremental approach. 
Waterfall example:for projects with fixed requirements and clear goals
Agile exapmle: for projects with changing requirements or that require fast-paced development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Designs, writes, and maintains code.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Bug tests software to ensure it satisfies quality standards.
Project Manager: Oversees the project's progress, making sure it fulfills deadlines, budgets, and stakeholder expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Help developers write, debug, and test code more efficiently (e.g., Visual Studio).
Version Control System (VCS): Manage code modifications and developer collaboration (using tools such as Git).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Use agile methodologies to adjust to changing requirements.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or functionalities.
Integration testing involves determining how different components function together.
System testing involves ensuring that the entire system meets all of the requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Ensuring that the system meets the requirements of end users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the act of creating and modifying inputs (prompts) to help AI models, such as language models, deliver desired results. It's important because detailed commands result in more accurate, valuable responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about waakye."
Improved Prompt:
"Describe the key ingredients and preparation steps for making waakye."
